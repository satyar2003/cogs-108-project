    "By dominating the 'New York Times Bestseller' list, we are referring to novels maintaining top rankings on the list for the longest number of weeks. The factors we will be exploring are the inclusion of current events in the novel, author credibility/experience (determined by whether the author has had previous 'New York Times Bestseller' books), average ratings (Goodreads), number of awards received, appearance on a celebrity book club list, and publication timing (season). Using our research, authors aiming for recognition on the 'New York Times Bestseller' list in this genre may consider certain inclusions, such as references to current events, in their work, while publishers can identify effective marketing strategies to reach a wider audience."

    "Many of us have read books for pleasure at some point of time in our lives, and oftentimes, looking at the backs of the covers of these books, we see the title, “New York Times Bestseller.” With youthful enthusiasm, we’d look at those books and think of how impressive they are, and we’d think, “Oh, these books must be some of the best books in the world!”\n",
    "\n",
    "But what actually is it? Pamela Koehne-Drube<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4), freelance writer, describes the NYT Bestseller’s list as “the most famous list of bestselling books in the United States”, releasing publications in the NYT Book Review since 1931. However, the list of bestselling books is not as straightforward or cut and dry as they appear to be. The committee “have a proprietary way of analyzing sales data that is kept a closely guarded trade secret … and a lot of the final list placement is also based on editorial decisions rather than on raw sales data.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we’d like to see what actually happens behind the scenes to determine what drives the decision-making behind what factors influence which books are on the Bestseller’s list, specifically in the Paperback Nonfiction category, between the years 2020-2023. Certainly, causation isn’t correlation, but we aim to determine what characteristics in a book do end up correlating in the books reaching the Bestseller category.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been quite a bit of prior research on the topic, as it is such an important one for any author to make it in the industry, as arriving on the Bestseller’s lists often boosts sales for long term. While there hasn’t been too much research done on the categories correlated with the success of nonfiction books, there have been quite a few analyses on novels by famed authors and literature scientists like Jodie Archer<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1), who, describes what a bestseller reads like, to see if there’s an algorithm which bestsellers follow. Her dissertation, at least for novels, have proven that there can be algorithms developed which can predict whether novels end up being making bestseller lists up to 86% accuracy, and while a lot of these novels do follow certain schema, she emphasizes the existence of “freak bestsellers” which gained infamy by defying traditional schematics. However, this is a judgment of fiction novels, and we are curious as to see if these trends apply to nonfiction paperbacks as well. Specifically, we wish to pin down which characteristics of these books contribute to them being on the list, characteristics that are not directly related to the quality of writing / the plot of the characters or any other more surface-level analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In her book<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2), Archer makes considerable sociological commentary on machine-written books, and how following a certain algorithm could guarantee publication, and she makes specific references to certain kinds of imagery and depictions within novels, the usage of specific themes, as well as plot devices the books should use to succeed. She frames the “algorithmic method” by also providing cases of success where these algorithms don’t apply, and uses that message to showcase the importance of natural authors in the writing field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other authors<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) have attempted analyses that are more specific, who aimed to analyze the effects of critic reviews on book sales and have determined that it’s not just the tone of a review which matters, but also the fact of whether the books stay “in conversation” for longer, such as if they appear to be controversial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Something to take note of is that very few of these authors have attempted to establish a robust means for classification of these best sellers, choosing to either specialize on factors to analyze or focusing more on the content of the writing than the institution itself. The goal of our project is not only to analyze which characteristics of these books get them on the NYT Bestseller’s List, but also to analyze if it is reasonable for these characteristics to be why, and whether the NYT Bestseller’s List is actually representative of the quality of these books. Likewise, there has been quite a bit of focus on works of fiction, and we believe that focusing on nonfiction elements, which don’t necessarily focus on the engagement of plots or character tropes, would allow for a more stable analysis that escapes from “fads” of some kinds.\n",

    "Our null hypothesis is that none of the factors (inclusion of current events, author credibility, average ratings, number of awards received, appearance on a celebrity book club list, or publication timing/season) significantly influence a novel's likelihood of dominating the 'New York Times Bestseller' list for the 'Paperback Nonfiction' category in the time frame from 2020 to 2023.\n",
    "Our alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the factors significantly influences a novel's likelihood of dominating the 'New York Times Bestseller' list for the 'Paperback Nonfiction' category in the time frame from 2020 to 2023. We will be using a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, as this has been conventionally accepted as the threshold to discriminate significant from non-significant results in statistical testing.\n",

    "In particular, we think that the inclusion of current events most significantly impacts a paperback nonfiction book's likelihood of maintaining a top position on the 'New York Times Bestseller' list.\n",
    "We believe that people are more likely to read nonfiction novels that relate to or are concerning current events, especially during pivotal moments in history, such as during election seasons.\n",
    "Since our data set includes a presidential election year, 2020, we think this factor would strongly impact the likelihood of a nonfiction novel gaining popularity and becoming a 'New York Times Bestseller' from 2020 to 2023.\n",
    "Essentially, we are assuming that people who aren't regular nonfiction readers would typically only become interested in this genre when seeking to increase their awareness of current events."

    "Before collecting data, we originally thought there would be 150-300 observations in our dataset; our rationale was that there are only around 75 unique 'Paperback Nonfiction' novels on the 'New York Times Bestseller' list per year and our dataset spans 4 years. However, our current dataset includes over 3000 observations, with many title repeats, because we would like to take into consideration the change in rank per week and the number of weeks that a certain novel remained on the list in the time frame from 2020-2023. If there happens to be any missing data or discrepencies, we will leave the missing data as N/A and tailor our analysis based on which data is missing and how much of it is missing. \n",

    "For our curated dataset, we have 12 variables: book title, author, publisher, year on list, rank on list, # of weeks on list, whether book contents pertained to current issues, # of awards, publication season, appearance on a celebrity book club list, # of previous bestseller books by the same author, and average rating on Goodreads. \n",

    "The book title, author, and publisher data is in a string/object format, while the year on list and rank on list data is in an int format.

    "For the current context variable, we looked at book summaries on goodreads and determined if the book discussed current cultural, political, or any other type of issue versus if it was timeless or historical. The datatype is either 'Yes' if the book does have current context or 'No' if it does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the author to bestsellers and contiguous stretches on the bestselling lists for each unique title, we called HTTP Requests from the NYT Books API, and converted the data into CSV palatable for usage. The data we have, being the unique titles and author names are Strings, whereas the counts for both the number of publications and the number of contiguous weeks on the list are int datatypes.\n",

    "For the appearance on a celebrity book club list, we iterated through NYTinfo.csv to check whether each book had appeared on a celebrity's book club list.
